# TDD Best Practices Sessions

These sessions speak about a list of best practices for TDD and Unit Tests

## Sessions

### Session 2
- Idea of a tiny universe - tests exist to test one thing only
- Follow one Assert per Test principle
- Do not test implementation Details (behavior verification)

### Session 3
- Arrange-Act-Assert 
- Naming conventions in the tests
- Tests should be DAMP and not DRY
